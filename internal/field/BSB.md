# Site description

Big Southern Butte is a volcanic dome cinder cone approximately 4 km
wide that rises 800 m above the upper Snake River Plain in southeastern Idaho. The dominant vegetation on the Upper Snake River Plain and Big Southern Butte is grass and sagebrush, although a few
north-facing slopes on the butte have some isolated stands of conifers.

## Conclusions

***

- Surface winds on and around Big Southern Butte were completely decoupled from large-scale flows during upslope and downslope flow regimes, except for the highest-elevation ridge-top sensors.

- Wind speeds increased with distance upslope during the upslope regime.

- The highest speeds measured at Big Southern Butte occurred during the
passage of frontal systems that generated strong southwesterly flows and during infrequent strong northwesterly flows presumably generated through SPCZ-like dynamics, thunderstorm outflows, or surface  pressure  gradients.  

- The findings from this work along with the additional archived data and available mesonet data at BSB should provide guidance for future development and evaluation of high-resolution wind models and integrated parameterizations, such as for simulating diurnal slope flows and non-neutral atmospheric stability effects.


# Note

All  data  are  archived  and  available  to  the  public.  Surface  observations  for  each  site  are  available  as  SQLite databases. Data from sodars, radar profilers, sonic anemometers, weather stations, and radiosondes are available in their raw formats. Access to these data along with tools to query,process, and visualize the data is described at [https://collab.firelab.org/software/projects/wind-obs/repository](https://collab.firelab.org/software/projects/wind-obs/repository).
