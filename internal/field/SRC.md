# Site description

The site was a stretch of the Salmon River Canyon upstream of Riggins Idaho. The canyon follows a nearly east-west path within this extent. Prevailing winds in the region are from the west. The predominant vegetation is grass with some timber in the higher elevations on the northerly aspects. Instrumentation was deployed away from forested areas.

Characteristic synoptically driven regime events


## Conclusions

***

- Surface winds in Salmon River Canyon were decoupled from large-scale flows except during periods of strong  synoptic forcing that enhanced either upriver or downriver flows.

- Wind speeds generally decreased with distance upslope during the upslope regime.

- Wind speed generally increased with distance upslope at Salmon River Canyon

-  The  highest  speeds  measured at SRC occurred during late morning hours and
were from easterly flows presumably produced by surface pressure gradients induced by formation of a thermal trough over the Columbia Plateau to the northwest and high pressure to the east. The highest wind speeds during these pressure-driven  easterly  flow events were measured at the mid to high-elevation sensors.

- These  results  have  important  implications  for  modeling near-surface winds in complex terrain. The fact that surface winds at both sites tended to be decoupled from large-scale flows under periods of weak synoptic forcing suggests that traditional operational weather model winds (i.e., with numerical  grid  resolutions  of  around  4 km  or  larger)  are  not likely to be good predictors of local winds in sub-grid scale complex terrain.


# Note

All  data  are  archived  and  available  to  the  public.  Surface  observations  for  each  site  are  available  as  SQLite databases. Data from sodars, radar profilers, sonic anemometers, weather stations, and radiosondes are available in their raw formats. Access to these data along with tools to query,process, and visualize the data is described at [https://collab.firelab.org/software/projects/wind-obs/repository](https://collab.firelab.org/software/projects/wind-obs/repository).
