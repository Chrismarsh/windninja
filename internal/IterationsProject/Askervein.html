    <h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline" style="color:white;">Iterations Project: Askervein Hill</h1>
    <p>The Askervein Hill elevation file (57<sup>o</sup>11.313'N, 7<sup>o</sup>22.360'W) was the site of a large
wind measurement study that we've used for testing WindNinja in the past.</p>
    <p>The terrain isn't as complex as the Salmon River, but is still more complex than Big Butte Small. So it
works as our medium difficulty test case. </p>

      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Velocity and Angle Plots:</span> These plots are the direct values of
wind velocity and wind direction from WindNinja's resulting .asc files. The velocity colors are very similar
to the colors seen in WindNinja's .kmz files. The angle colors were chosen to be able to see all the different
types of directions all at once. These plots are handy for directly knowing what WindNinja's results look
like.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Velocity Difference and Angle Difference Plots:</span> These plots are
the most useful of the plots. They were obtained by taking the values of all the velocities and angles of a
single iteration and subtracting them from all the velocities and angles of the converged solution. It makes
it really easy to see the progress of convergence with increasing the number of iterations. Comparing these
plots with the angle and velocity plots is also handy for determining where recirculation zones occur.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Residual Plots:</span> These plots are really handy for making sure
that WindNinja's solver is working correctly. During each solver step, the solver compares many solved
variables at each step with the same solved variables from the previous step. These differences are the
residuals and help the solver know when to properly change calculation steps.</p>
      <p>These plots are the residuals at the start of the final iteration and at the end of the final iteration.
The fact that the residuals change from relatively big values to very small values means that WindNinja is
working properly.</p>
      <p>The variable symbols mean the following:</p>
      <p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Ux</span> is the velocity going in the forward
or the downwind direction.</p>
      <p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Uy</span> is the velocity going in the left and
right or the lateral direction.</p>
      <p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Uz</span> is the velocity going in the up and
down or the vertical direction.</p>
      <p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Pressure</span> is the pressure at the specific
point.</p>
      <p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:bold">k</span> is the turbulent kinetic energy per
unit mass as used in the k-ε formula for Reynold's Stresses</p>
      <p style="text-indent:40px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Epsilon</span> is the rate of dissipation of
turbulent kinetic energy as used in the k-ε formula for Reynold's Stresses</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Iteration vs Error Plots:</span> These plots are handy for seeing the
progression to full convergence in a single plot. The sum plots are the sum of all the velocity differences
and angle differences at each iteration. The RMS plots are the Root Mean Square of all the velocity and
angle differences where the converged solution is used as the mean.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Continuity Errors and Simulation Time Summaries Plots:</span> The
continuity error plots are the values obtained from adding all the residuals at given iteration together. The
residuals were obtained from the last calculation done by the solver at each given iteration. They help to
know that WindNinja is working correctly.</p>
      <p>The Total Simulation Time plot is more useful. It shows how long each simulation took when WindNinja's
solver cuts off at different iterations. It shows the reason why running WindNinja at fewer iterations is so
important.</p>
