## What is WindNinja?

WindNinja is a computer program that computes spatially varying wind fields for
wildland fire application. It is specifically designed to simulate the effect of terrain on wind flow. Unlike traditional weather models, WindNinja does not predict wind for future times, rather it simulates the spatial variation of wind for one instant in time (it does not step forward in time).


### These Tutorials provide basic instruction in the main features of WindNinja.
