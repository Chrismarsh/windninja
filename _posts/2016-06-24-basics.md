## Getting Started

### What is WindNinja?

WindNinja is a computer program that computes spatially varying wind fields for
wildland fire application. It is specifically designed to simulate the effect of terrain on wind flow. Unlike traditional weather models, WindNinja does not predict wind for future times, rather it simulates the spatial variation of wind for one instant in time (it does not step forward in time).


#### Tutorial 1:The Basics

This tutorial provides a step by step guide to running a basic WindNinja simulation.


##### [Tutorial 1](http://firelab.github.io/windninja/pdf/WindNinja_tutorial1.pdf)

#### Tutorial 2: Diurnal Winds and Non-neutral Stability

This tutorial will step you through the process of running a WindNinja simulation that includes diurnal slope winds and an atmospheric stability that is not neutral.

#### Tutorial 3: Point Initialization

This tutorial will step you through the process of running a WindNinja simulation that is initialized by location specific wind information.  Note that the point initialization option is not currently available for use with the momentum solver.
