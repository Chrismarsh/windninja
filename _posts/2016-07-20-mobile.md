The WindNinja computer program is a powerful tool for predicting wind fields in complex terrain, but is inconvenient for field users. To solve this problem, WindNinja-Mobile has been developed so field going personnel can also benefit from these high resolution wind forecasts on their phones and tablets. This tool provides improved capability to identify areas where local winds may either increase fire behavior or not influence fire. This information helps us all to make better fire management decisions.

The mobile app allows users to set up and run WindNinja simulations on a remote server. When the simulation is done, the results can be downloaded and viewed in the app. Internet connectivity is only required to setup and then download a simulation (typically < 15 min.), after that viewing of wind vectors can be done without connectivity. Several map layers, including topo and aerial imagery are available as basemaps. Additional fire-related information, including MODIS fire detections and GEOMAC fire perimeters, can also be viewed on the map.

Setting up a simulation is easy. Simply swoop out an area of interest on the map, provide a run name, select a weather model, choose notification options, and click submit. When the run has completed, click to download and view the output on the map.

WindNinja-Mobile offers a simplified interface, so not all options available in desktop WindNinja are available in the mobile application.

## Features and Limitations



#### Weather Model Initialization
***


WindNinja-Mobile currently initializes only via a weather model. Two weather models are available, Short-term and Long-term. The long-term forecast model uses NAM and the short-term forecast model uses HRRR.

- *NAM* or North American Mesoscale Forecast System is a numerical weather prediction model. NAM runs four times a day out to 84 hours. This model is known as long-term in WindNinja-Mobile. For more information on NAM, [see this page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/north-american-mesoscale-forecast-system-nam)

<br>

- *HRRR* or High Resolution Rapid Refresh is a model that is issued hourly and gives forecasts in 15 minute intervals. This model is known as short-term in WindNinja-Mobile. For more information on HRRR, [see this page](http://ruc.noaa.gov/hrrr/)

For simulations run in Alaska, the Alaska option corresponds to NAM-Alaska, as HRRR is not available for Alaska.

#### Spatial Limits
***

Currently WindNinja-mobile is limited to domains inside the continental United States (CONUS) and Alaska (AK). Additionally the  simulation area is limited 50x50 km.

<br>
<br>


#### Outputs
***

- All simulations use a 'fine' mesh, so the horizontal resolution will depend on the size of the domain. Smaller domains will have a finer horizontal resolution.

- Output wind height is 20 ft above the vegetation. This height was chosen because it is the standard wind height used for wildland fire applications.

- We use a rectangular bounding box for all simulations. The bounding box fully includes the area delineated by the red pen in the app.

- The diurnal wind option is turned on for all simulations.

#### These limitations may change depending on use, feedback and support following this current fire season (2016).
